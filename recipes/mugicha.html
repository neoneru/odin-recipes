        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p> Mugicha is the kind of thing you crave on a hot day. It's a cooling elixir that gets you through the sweaty sauna Japan becomes in summer, or cools you down after a long afternoon of wandering around Disneyland in bone-dry Anaheim, California, throwing up peace signs with Mickey Mouse.</p>
