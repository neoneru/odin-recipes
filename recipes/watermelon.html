        <h1>Watermelon Salad</h1>

        <img src="../img/watermelon.jpg">

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>It's not an immediately obvious combination: watermelon, cucumber, olives and feta; but one bite will leave you convinced that this savory-sweet summer salad is something truly special. The astringent punch of the olives and feta provides a sophisticated counterpoint to the watery mellowness of the melon and cucumber. With a hunk of bread, it's a lovely light lunch; with practically any grilled meat or fish, it's an ideal summer supper.</p>
